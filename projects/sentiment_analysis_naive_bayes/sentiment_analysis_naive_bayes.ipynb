        "## Clasificación de Sentimientos usando Naive Bayes\n",
        "\n",
        "Este proyecto tiene como objetivo construir un modelo de clasificación de sentimientos en reseñas de aplicaciones móviles mediante el algoritmo **Naive Bayes**. Esta técnica probabilística resulta especialmente útil en el análisis de texto por su eficiencia en contextos con múltiples atributos y clases bien definidas.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📦 Datos\n",
        "\n",
        "Se trabajó con un conjunto de reseñas reales de usuarios de 23 aplicaciones disponibles en la Google Play Store. Cada reseña incluye el texto y una etiqueta de polaridad que indica si la opinión es **neutral** (`0`) o refleja un **sentimiento intenso** positivo o negativo (`1`).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Objetivo del Proyecto\n",
        "\n",
        "Desarrollar un modelo que sea capaz de identificar automáticamente la polaridad del texto de una reseña. Esto permite categorizar los comentarios de los usuarios para facilitar la toma de decisiones basada en la percepción del producto.\n",
        "\n",
        "Una vez entrenado el modelo, se evaluó su rendimiento con un conjunto de validación y se exploraron mejoras para aumentar su precisión.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧪 Metodología\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Preprocesamiento y Limpieza de Texto\n",
        "\n",
        "Se realizó una limpieza profunda del texto, eliminando puntuación, símbolos y palabras irrelevantes. Se aplicaron técnicas de vectorización para transformar las reseñas en datos numéricos aptos para el entrenamiento.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Entrenamiento del Modelo\n",
        "\n",
        "Se utilizó **Naive Bayes** con una división de los datos entre entrenamiento y validación. Se analizó el rendimiento con métricas estándar como precisión, recall y matriz de confusión.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Optimización\n",
        "\n",
        "Se exploraron mejoras como **Laplace smoothing** y el uso de variables adicionales como `package_name` (nombre de la app) para enriquecer el modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📈 Resultados y Conclusiones\n",
        "\n",
        "El modelo fue capaz de capturar patrones clave en el lenguaje utilizado por los usuarios, permitiendo clasificar correctamente muchas de las reseñas. No obstante, se observaron diferencias de rendimiento entre algunas aplicaciones. Se proponen futuras mejoras como incorporar más contexto o ajustar el balance de clases.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧠 Reflexión\n",
        "\n",
        "Este proyecto demuestra cómo un modelo simple como Naive Bayes puede ser eficaz en tareas de análisis de sentimientos cuando se combina con un buen preprocesamiento y exploración cuidadosa de los datos.\n",
